I really dont have a good idea of what to do. I wanted to start homelabbing and disconnect off spotify and listen without ads i think i wont need help but it will take some time. (bc i just started programming) Feel free to modify! i wanted this to be open source, just dont steal my idea. **In short it's a server local spotify**
