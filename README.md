I really dont have a good idea of what to do. I wanted to start homelabbing and disconnect off spotify and listen without ads i think i wont need help but it will take some time. (bc i just started programming) Feel free to modify! i wanted this to be open source, just dont steal my idea. **In short it's a server local spotify** (i may not be active a lot of time (like posting 1 month to 1 year)
(hey and sorry if it isnt in english but in french bc i am... but probably when in the V.1 or V.0.1 gonna change the rest of the variables / comment in english and other languages)
